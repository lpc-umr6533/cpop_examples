     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            Example NanoparticleRadiation
                            --------------------------

  This example shows you how to simulate the effect of nanoparticle
  in the cell population using Geant4.

  This page only details the nanoparticle part but the example uses both
  a homogeneous source and a nanoparticle (distributed) one.

  To model nanoparticle, a simulation must be done beforehand to collect the secondary
  electrons and the energy spectrum.

 1- USAGE
 
  The executable has 2 options:
  - `-m filename`: path to Geant4 macro file;
  - `-t`: number of thread to use (only available if Geant4 has been built with multihread support).

  Example without Geant4 multithread:
  ```bash
  ./complexRadiation -m data/run.mac
  ```

  Example with Geant4 multithread (using hadd root executable to merge outputs):
  ```bash
  ./complexRadiation -m data/run.mac -t 4
  hadd result.root output_t{0..3}.root
  ```
   
 2- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
  A spheroid made of water cells is in the population.xml file.
 
 3- OPTIONS
 
  Once the energy spectrum is available, the user can choose :
  - the number of nanoparticle to distribute;
  - the distribution of the nanoparticle in the spheroid;
  - the position inside a cell;
  - the secondary particle generated by the nanoparticle `PrimaryGenerator`;
  - the secondary energy spectrum.
