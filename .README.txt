 This example shows how to use a configuration file to generate a population of cells.
 The population is generated between two spheres and can be compacted or spaced to model real situations.

\section B6_s1 USAGE

 The executable has 2 options:
 - `-f filename`: path to the configuration file;
 - `â€“vis`: generate a `.off` file to visualize your population with geomview (optional).

 Example:
 ```bash
 ./generatePopulation -f data/exampleConfig.cfg --vis
 geomview data/exampleConfig.cfg.off &
 ```

 In the data directory, you will find `exampleConfig.xml` which can be used to simulate radiation exposure in Geant4.
