# UniformRadiation

This example shows you how to apply radiation exposure on a cell population using Geant4.

The user can choose:
- the PhysicsList: emstandard; emstandard_opt1; emstandard_opt2; emstandard_opt3; emstandard_opt4; emlivermore; empenelope; emDNAphysics;
- the particle generated by the `PrimaryGenerator`;
- the energy spectrum;
- the number of cell to observe during the simulation (used to reduce computation time).

## Usage

The executable has 2 options:
- `-m filename`: path to Geant4 macro file;
- `-t`: number of thread to use (only available if Geant4 has been built with multihread support).

Example without Geant4 multithread:
```bash
./homogeneousRadiation -m data/run.mac
```

Example with Geant4 multithread (using hadd root executable to merge outputs):
```bash
./homogeneousRadiation -m data/run.mac -t 4
hadd result.root output_t{0..3}.root
```
