 This example shows you how to apply radiation exposure on a cell population using Geant, 
 using an uniform particle source.

\section UniformRadiation USAGE

   The executable has 2 options:
  - `-m filename`: path to Geant4 macro file;
  - `-t`: number of thread to use (only available if Geant4 has been built with multihread support).

  Example without Geant4 multithread:
  ```bash
  ./complexRadiation -m data/run.mac
  ```

  Example with Geant4 multithread (using hadd root executable to merge outputs):
  ```bash
  ./complexRadiation -m data/run.mac -t 4
  hadd result.root output_t{0..3}.root
  ```
  
\section UniformRadiation GEOMETRY DEFINITION

  A spheroid made of water cells is in the population.xml file.
  
\section UniformRadiation OPTIONS

  The user can choose:
   - the PhysicsList: emstandard; emstandard_opt1; emstandard_opt2; emstandard_opt3; emstandard_opt4; emlivermore; empenelope; emDNAphysics;
   - the particle generated by the `PrimaryGenerator`;
   - the energy spectrum;
   - the number of cell to observe during the simulation (used to reduce computation time).
