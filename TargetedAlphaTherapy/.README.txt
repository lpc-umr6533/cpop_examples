/*! \page TargetedAlphaTherapy Example %TargetedAlphaTherapy

 This example presents the irradiation of a spheroid by a targeted alpha therapy
 treatment. Alpha particles are emitted in cells and different physical 
 quantities are collected in all cells.

\section TargetedAlphaTherapy USAGE

 ```sh
  source path/to/geant4/gean4.sh
  ./targetedAlphaTherapy -m data/run.mac
  ```

  If you are using `G4MULTITHREADED`, merge your root outputs with:

  ```sh
  hadd output.root output_t{0..N}.root
  ```

  Example: if you used 4 threads:

  ```sh
  hadd result.root output_t{0..3}.root
  ```

  ```
  Help :

  Usage: complexRadiation  [-t <int>] -m=<file>

    Required options:
    -m, --macro=file          macro file(default: input_filename.mac)

    Optional options:
    -t, --thread=int          number of threads(only available with G4 multithread option)
  ```
 
\section TargetedAlphaTherapy GEOMETRY DEFINITION

  3 geometries are available in the data folder: a 95 Âµm radius spheroid with 3 degrees
  of compaction (25, 50 and 75 %). The cells are made of liquid water.
  These spheroids were generated with the GeneratePopulation example. Any spheroid
  generated by this example can be used as an input of the TargetedAlphaTherapy example 
  via the .xml file.
  
\section TargetedAlphaTherapy INCIDENT PARTICLES

  Particles can be chosen in the run.mac file with the "name_source"/particle or /ion
  option. They are emitted in the chosen cell compartments via the distributionInCell
  command.

\section TargetedAlphaTherapy PHYSICS LIST

  These physics constructor can be chosen in the run.mac:
  emstandard, emstandard_opt1, emstandard_opt2, emstandard_opt3, emstandard_opt4,
  emlivermore, empenelope, emDNAphysics, emDNAphysics_opt2, emDNAphysics_opt4,
  emDNAphysics_opt6

\section TargetedAlphaTherapy OPTIONS

  - number of particle sources: /radionuclide/totalSource
  - number of primary particles per source: /radionuclide/particlesPerSource
  - maximum source of particles per cell: /maxSourcesPerCell
  - emission site of particles in cells: /distributionInCell
  - on a cell, choose if multiple emission sites
  - percentage of cells labeled with particles per region: /cellLabelingPercentagePerRegion
  - maximum step length between two interactions: /stepMax
  - define spheroid regions: /population/internalRatio and /externalRatio
  - diffusion of radionuclide's daughter after fixation (only for At-211 for now): /daughterDiffusion
  
\section TargetedAlphaTherapy OUTPUT
  
   With the `/cpop/population/eventInfo 1` option (the intended one for this example),
  the output root file contains:

  - the initial name of the Particle in the event. If the name is `EndOfRun`,
    it means that the data are stored at the run level, not at the event action
    one (each value will be equal to 0, except the doses in cells, and their id);
  - each time a primary particle enter in a nucleus during the event: its entrances energies;
  - each time a primary particle exit in a nucleus during the event: its exit energies.
    If the particle stops in the nucleus, Ef = 0;
  - ID of the cell that the particle crossed;
  - eventID:
  - ID of the cell from where the particle originated;
  - If particleName is `EndOfRun`, dose deposited in the cell nucleus;
  - If particleName is `EndOfRun`, dose deposited in the cell;
  - If particleName is `EndOfRun`, dose deposited in the spheroid;
  - If the particle source in this event has diffused before the particle
    emission, equal to 1.
