/*! \page GeneratePopulation Example %GeneratePopulation

 This example shows how to use a configuration file to generate a population of cells.
 The population is generated between two spheres and can be compacted or spaced to model
 real situations.

\section GeneratePopulation USAGE

 The executable has 2 options:
 - `-f filename`: path to the configuration file;
 - `â€“vis`: generate a `.off` file to visualize your population with geomview (optional).

 Example:
 ```bash
 ./generatePopulation -f data/exampleConfig.cfg --vis
 geomview data/exampleConfig.cfg.off &
 ```

 In the data directory, you will find `exampleConfig.xml` which can be used to simulate
 radiation exposure in Geant4.
 Also, you will find 'exampleConfig.cfg' which contains a set of parameters that can be
 used and/or modified to generate a cell population
 
 \section GeneratePopulation PARAMETERS
 
 In the GeneratePopulation directory, you will find 'configParameters.odt' which details
 all the different parameters that can be modified for the cell population generation.
   
 They are divided in several categories: cell, spheroid, mesh, force and simulation
 properties.
